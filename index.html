    <h1>How I find Holberton?</h1>
    <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com">

    <p>A couple years ago I found information about Holberton School on the internet; I was immediately struck by the way they learned. Some years ago I had the experience of studying based on self-discipline. This type of education seems me very appropriate, especially to reduce the reluctance of people when it comes to studying and also because it greatly reduces study times</p>

    <h1>Why I like Holeberton?</h1>
    <p>
      There are several things that catch my attention from Holberton
    </p>

    <h3>First</h3>
    <p>The way in which Holberton sees education, as a personal challenge and not an obligation of society.</p>

    <h3>Second</h3>
    <p>The time that must be invested to achieve the objective; We live in the information age, which is the fastest era of all stages of humanity, if we do not enter the arena we will simply stay behind!.</p>

    <h3>Third</h3>
    <p>The Motivation is the inclusion they offer; In many countries the undergraduate programs have been the subject of division of society due to the high costs of the races, Holberton breaks with this.</p>

    <h3>Fourth</h3>
    <p>The business positioning offered by Holberton, I mean the jobs that I can get to be a Holberton graduate.</p>
    <p>Many other things call my attention to Holberton, the places of study they offer, the community that has been formed by motivated apprentices, the high quality of their mentors and also the project-based education.</p>
